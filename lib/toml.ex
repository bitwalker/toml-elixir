  Decode the given binary as TOML content

  ## Options

  You can pass the following options to configure the decoder behavior:

    * `:filename` - pass a filename to use in error messages
    * `:keys` - controls how keys in the document are decoded. Possible values are:

      * `:strings` (default) - decodes keys as strings
      * `:atoms` - converts keys to atoms with `String.to_atom/1`
      * `:atoms!` - converts keys to atoms with `String.to_existing_atom/1`
      * `(key -> term)` - converts keys using the provided function

    * `:transforms` - a list of custom transformations to apply to decoded TOML values,
      see `c:Toml.Transform.transform/2` for details.

  ## Decoding keys to atoms

  The `:atoms` option uses the `String.to_atom/1` call that can create atoms at runtime.
  Since the atoms are not garbage collected, this can pose a DoS attack vector when used
  on user-controlled data. It is recommended that if you either avoid converting to atoms,
  by using `keys: :strings`, or require known keys, by using the `keys: :atoms!` option,
  which will cause decoding to fail if the key is not an atom already in the atom table.

  ## Transformations

  You should rarely need custom datatype transformations, but in some cases it can be quite
  useful. In particular if you want to transform things like IP addresses from their string
  form to the Erlang address tuples used in most `:inet` APIs, a custom transform can ensure
  that all addresses are usable right away, and that validation of those addresses is done as
  part of decoding the document.

  Keep in mind that transforms add additional work to decoding, which may result in reduced
  performance, if you don't need the convenience, or the validation, deferring such conversions
  until the values are used may be a better approach, rather than incurring the overhead during decoding.
